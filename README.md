# Uninitialized Signal in VHDL Process

This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL code: an uninitialized signal within a process.  Uninitialized signals can lead to unpredictable behavior during simulation and synthesis, making debugging challenging. The example shows how to correctly initialize a signal to avoid such problems.

## Bug Description

The `bug.vhdl` file contains a VHDL entity with a process that uses an uninitialized signal (`internal_data`).  Because no initial value is assigned, its value is undefined at the start of simulation, potentially leading to unexpected outputs.

## Bug Solution

The `bugSolution.vhdl` file demonstrates the corrected code. The signal `internal_data` is now explicitly initialized to "00" using the `:= x"00"` assignment.  This ensures a defined starting state, making the behavior predictable and avoiding potential issues.
